# Nic Cage Marathon — Voting System

A Firebase-hosted web app for voting on which Nicolas Cage movies to watch at a marathon event. Voters submit preferences and enthusiasm ratings; the organizer sees a live ranked results dashboard.

**Live site:** https://nic-cage-marathon.web.app

## How It Works

### For Voters

1. Open the voting link
2. Enter your name
3. Check movies you're interested in, or just click a star to mark interested and rate in one step
4. Rate your enthusiasm 1–5 stars
5. Optionally add food pairing ideas, comments, or write-in movie suggestions
6. Submit — your vote is saved instantly to Firebase

### For the Organizer

Open the results dashboard (link in the voting form) to see:
- Live rankings weighted by interest % and average enthusiasm rating
- Per-movie voter lists and score breakdowns
- A suggested schedule starting at 10 AM
- Write-in candidate suggestions from voters
- Food pairing ideas (public)
- Voter comments (passphrase-protected — default: `cagemaster`, set in `results-dashboard.html`)
- JSON and CSV export

## Ranking Algorithm

```
Score = (interest % × 0.7) + (avg rating / 5 × 100 × 0.3)
```

70% of the score is how many people want to see the movie; 30% is how enthusiastic those people are. This surfaces broad consensus while still rewarding films people feel strongly about.

## Managing the Movie List

Movies are stored in `movies.json`. Each entry has:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Raising Arizona",
  "year": 1987,
  "runtime": 94,
  "imdbRating": 7.3,
  "rtCriticRating": 91,
  "rtAudienceRating": 88,
  "fresh": true,
  "plot": "A childless couple...",
  "posterUrl": "https://...",
  "imdbId": "tt0093popularity",
  "rtUrl": "/m/raising_arizona"
}
```

**To add a movie:**

1. Add an entry to `movies.json` with at minimum `id`, `title`, `year`, and `imdbId`
2. Run `python3 enrich-movies.py` to auto-fill `posterUrl`, `imdbRating`, `rtCriticRating`, and `runtime` from the OMDb API
3. Manually fill in:
   - `rtUrl` — copy the path from the movie's Rotten Tomatoes URL (e.g. `/m/raising_arizona`)
   - `rtAudienceRating` — not available from OMDb; enter from the RT page
   - `"fresh": true` — add only if the movie is Certified Fresh on RT

The OMDb API key is hardcoded at the top of `enrich-movies.py`. Get a free key at https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx if you need to replace it.
